# TrackingCVWebsite written in Python
I wrote a program, which tracks if anyone uploaded an offer on the cv website. If they do, then I will get a mail message.

A Simple scraper code, which consists of few parts.
1st: Finds how old is the job offer is offered

2nd: Checks if the job offer is about given keywords. In my situation is: React, Junior, Javascript, Python.

3rd: If the offer is posted not more than 24 hours, then the e-mail letter is sent in the given E-mail.
